# HAB4

##### Overview

This repository is for the scientific high-altitude balloon (HAB) board which will serve as a learning experience for new RIT SPEX members by providing:

   - Programming experience through an Arduino-compatible microcontroller
 
   - System-level experience by providing all necessary functions for a HAB launch and flight
 
   - This project will help the SPEX team by providing:
 
   - A real, scientific payload to be launched and the following report.
 
   - The public relations opportunity that comes along with a video.
 
   - Individuals working on this project will be able to apply what they learn in the classroom towards a physical project that represents one of the cheapest and easiest forms of basic space exploration.
